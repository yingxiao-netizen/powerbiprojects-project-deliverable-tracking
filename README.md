# Power BI Projects - project deliverable tracking

This Power BI dashboard is to view the most important KPI's and results of a large engineering project across several disciplines, and to provide the key results immediately. 
Dashboards are an interactive way to see how the company or project perform. 

By using dashboards, you will discover the right insights in an easy way. You can apply filters yourself and consult different graphs. By immediately having the right information available, correct decisions can be made.
